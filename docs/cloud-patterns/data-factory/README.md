# Cloud Patterns for Azure Data Factory

Data Factory pipelines map well to patterns that structure processing into stages, isolate failures, and handle retries.

## Patterns covered

1. Pipes and Filters
2. Retry
3. Scheduler Agent Supervisor (pipeline orchestration)
4. Strangler Fig (incremental migration of data integration)
